## Quick Start

### For Beginners
1. Start with `01_Fundamentals` to understand core concepts
2. Read `INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md` for interview preparation
3. Practice with simple case studies in `04_Case_Studies`

### For Experienced Engineers
1. Review `03_Patterns` for advanced architectural patterns
2. Study real-world examples in `04_Case_Studies`
3. Use `02_Components` for component-specific deep dives

### For Interview Preparation
1. Read `INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md` first
2. Practice 2-3 case studies from `04_Case_Studies`
3. Review `01_Fundamentals` for key concepts
